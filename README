Linux kernel
============

wheatfox's instructions:

1. use `build.sh` to build linux kernel targeting loongarch64, you can use `build.sh help` to check avaliable commands.
2. the initramfs's rootfs.cpio.gz's location is hardcoded into config file, you need to specify it in `build.sh menuconfig`'s General Setup!
3. once you've set your desired initramfs gzip file, it will be save into .config for later use in compiling linux kernel.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
